									<h3>Comparing Unstable Cislunar Orbits for Efficient Transfers to Deep-Space Targets (2021-2024)</h3>
									<p>
										With increasing interest in cislunar operations and exploration of deep space destinations like Mars, a foundational understanding of cislunar dynamics and 
										their potential for facilitating departure from the vicinity of Earth is essential. This investigation addresses this need by analyzing system departure 
										characteristics from a variety of periodic orbit families with unstable members in the Earth-Moon Circular-Restricted 3-Body Problem (CR3BP). Specifically, a 
										cislunar-to-Mars transfer methodology is developed, leveraging multi-body dynamical systems theory, especially invariant manifolds of periodic orbits, to 
										design lower-energy deep space transfers in comparison to traditional methods. The proposed approach generates families of end-to-end transfers that vary in 
										total maneuver delta-v cost and time-of-flight, originating from different unstable cislunar orbits. The tradespaces of these transfer families are then 
										analyzed and compared across various departure orbits to identify departure characteristics across orbit families and energy levels (Jacobi constants). The 
										analysis reveals certain unstable Earth-Moon CR3BP orbit families with more favorable departure characteristics. Additionally, this investigation compares the 
										computed deep space transfer costs with those of traditional interplanetary transfers and others from existing literature. Although this transfer design 
										strategy is specifically applied to Mars transfers in this investigation, the methodology is broadly applicable to other deep space destinations. Furthermore, 
										the general findings on cislunar departure characteristics have implications for mission designs to destinations beyond the Earth-Moon region.

									<h3>A Parametric Study of Hypersonic Waverider Flight Mechanics in Optimized Trajectories during Atmospheric Entry (2019-2021)</h3>
									<p>
										The purpose of this research project was to provide a brief analysis of unpowered skip and glide entry trajectories and to present an optimized hypersonic 
										waverider trajectory for a simple atmospheric reentry scenario. Five main types of unpowered glide trajectories—constant flight path angle, constant sinking 
										speed, constant flight speed, constant dynamic pressure, and constant heating rate—were analyzed using MATLAB to model the altitude, velocity, flight path 
										angle, and lift modulation profiles. Additionally, constant aerodynamic efficiency skip trajectories were analyzed for their ability to extend reentry ranges. 
										The results of these analyses were then used to optimize a combined skip-glide atmospheric reentry trajectory for hypersonic waveriders about the Earth’s 
										equator. This research utilized a classical optimization approach, using MATLAB to graph the applicable design spaces for the analysis. The resulting 
										trajectory maximizes the range of the reentry trajectory while conforming to applied maximum aerodynamic heating and maximum dynamic pressure constraints. The 
										findings of this research will benefit the aerospace community by providing insight into hypersonic waverider performance during Earth reentry after completed 
										space missions. This information can be used to inform flight vehicle design decisions for optimizing hypersonic waverider performance. Moreover, beyond just 
										Earth atmospheric reentry, the analyses used in this research can also be applied to atmospheric entry into other planetary atmospheres, aiding in vehicle 
										design and planning for interplanetary missions.
