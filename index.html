									<h3>Leveraging Cislunar Periodic Orbit Dynamics for Efficient Access to Deep Space Targets (Current)</h3>
									<p>
										One of the biggest disadvantages of current low-energy transfer methodologies for deep-space trajectories is their long transit times. Within Earth-Moon 
										multi-body dynamics models, there are a variety of periodic orbit families available in cislunar space. Many of these orbit families possess unstable invariant 
										manifolds that can be used to design transfer trajectories that ballistically depart from the system. However, studies so far have only investigated the use of 
										a few L1 and L2 Lyapunov and halo orbits near the Moon for deep-space transfers. The proposed research aims to analyze which families of orbits in the 
										Earth-Moon system can provide access to fuel-efficient deep-space transfer opportunities. The goal is to compare the available unstable invariant manifolds 
										departing from various periodic orbit families to determine which ones depart the system faster than others and reach further into heliocentric space. This 
										analysis will examine multiple transfer types and geometries, including Sun-Earth staging orbits and Earth or Moon flybys, and will compare results with 
										existing literature. Determining the best departure orbit families will help inform deep-space mission architectures and provide a framework for fuel-efficient 
										deep-space transfer trajectory design. It will also provide more insight into the underlying natural dynamics of the cislunar region and its interactions with 
										interplanetary space. Furthermore, it has implications for future cislunar space station and depot placements to facilitate deep-space missions. This analysis 
										has the potential to produce low-energy, deep-space transfer trajectories with relatively low times-of-flight, a result crucial to furthering NASA’s 
										exploration goals.

									<h3>A Parametric Study of Hypersonic Waverider Flight Mechanics in Optimized Trajectories during Atmospheric Entry (2019-2021)</h3>
									<p>
										The purpose of this research project was to provide a brief analysis of unpowered skip and glide entry trajectories and to present an optimized hypersonic 
										waverider trajectory for a simple atmospheric reentry scenario. Five main types of unpowered glide trajectories—constant flight path angle, constant sinking 
										speed, constant flight speed, constant dynamic pressure, and constant heating rate—were analyzed using MATLAB to model the altitude, velocity, flight path 
										angle, and lift modulation profiles. Additionally, constant aerodynamic efficiency skip trajectories were analyzed for their ability to extend reentry ranges. 
										The results of these analyses were then used to optimize a combined skip-glide atmospheric reentry trajectory for hypersonic waveriders about the Earth’s 
										equator. This research utilized a classical optimization approach, using MATLAB to graph the applicable design spaces for the analysis. The resulting 
										trajectory maximizes the range of the reentry trajectory while conforming to applied maximum aerodynamic heating and maximum dynamic pressure constraints. The 
										findings of this research will benefit the aerospace community by providing insight into hypersonic waverider performance during Earth reentry after completed 
										space missions. This information can be used to inform flight vehicle design decisions for optimizing hypersonic waverider performance. Moreover, beyond just 
										Earth atmospheric reentry, the analyses used in this research can also be applied to atmospheric entry into other planetary atmospheres, aiding in vehicle 
										design and planning for interplanetary missions.
